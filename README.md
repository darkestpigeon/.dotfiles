# (Auto-) Installation
Installs `tmux`, `neovim` (from source), `pyenv-virtualenv`, `zsh` and `nodejs`
(for `pyright` LSP) and makes `zsh` the default shell.
Run `install.sh` from the repo's root directory. Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.

# Non-obvious dependencies
- grep search in neovim requires `ripgrep` to be installed
